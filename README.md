# Save Game Extractor
Save Game Extractor is a tool that automatically locates and copies save files for Windows games in public directories. Basically, it's a tiny program for quickly backing up your save files, without having to look for them one by one!

# What Save Game Extractor doesn't do
This program finds only saves in public directories, such as Documents/My Games/. Luckily, **most** games follow this trend.

There are 3 types of saves that can't be located with this program:
* Games that store their saves in launchers (such as Steam and Ubisoft Connect). Usually these are stored on the cloud, so it should be fine to ignore them.
* Games that store their saves in the game's installation folder. These vary wildly, so it's impossible to track them.
* Games that store their saves in the Windows Registry. I have no idea why some people do this.
